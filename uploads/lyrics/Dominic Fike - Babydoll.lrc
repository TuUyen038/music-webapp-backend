[00:10.56]I can't move on, baby doll
[00:13.64]Waitin' on calls
[00:15.21]Flippin' through stations
[00:16.67]I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
[00:21.68]And I'll take it all, baby doll
[00:25.31]Whatever's been weighin' you down
[00:28.45]
[00:33.99]Find me on Miami concrete
[00:36.96]Lookin' for somebody different 'cause my daddy was a pimp
[00:39.71]My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway
[00:42.74]Oh, baby doll
[00:44.91]Please don't call me for the wrong reasons
[00:48.67]We both know exactly what I'm thinkin'
[00:51.79]Weeks pass and I never grow tired
[00:53.99]'Cause I never say never and I barely ever lie
[00:56.80]I'm on a roll to an original place
[00:59.22]In outer space
[01:00.63]I didn't make it up, but you can't find it on a phone
[01:03.99]Or a globe
[01:05.06]And I can take you with me if you really wanna go
[01:08.54]Oh, baby doll
[01:10.70]I can't move on
[01:13.60]I can't move on, baby doll
[01:16.63]Waitin' on calls
[01:18.28]Flippin' through stations
[01:19.36]I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
[01:24.02]And I'll take it all, baby doll
[01:27.81]Whatever's been weighin' you down
